LACLEDESLAN BLIND FRAG SERVER
Welcome to the Laclede's LAN Blind Frag server! Remember that the person touching the controls MUST NOT LOOK AT THE SCREEN IN ANY WAY. And of course, the person giving directions MUST NOT TOUCH THE CONTROLS IN ANY WAY. This includes touching the arm or hand of the blind player. Work together as a team to get the most kills to win! Play fair and have fun!
